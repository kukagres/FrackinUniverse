  ^cyan;6.1.25^reset;

  -- Assets --
  * Buttons, icons, and UI/UX elements
  * added dyeable Avian hull panels
  * added GPS functions to tricorder
  * tons of UI edits

  -- Misc --
  * Unrefined Arkose should now break down in a Rock Breaker
  * Greatly increased width and depth for all Quarries
  * Completely overhauled the Tricorder
  * Watchers are more clear about what they are and how they impact performance, when inspected.
  * Feya can now properly be crafted
  * All core FU stations should be using the new interface, as well as the core stations at the science outpost. You may need to break and re-place them to see the proper titlebar text and not doubled-up text.
  * Gave the ITD Handler objects new icons
  * Added tags to the vast, vast majority of armor, particularly armor that's upgradeable. This should allow users to search in their crafting table to more directly find armors that suit their needs.
  * toned down geologist attack goggles scaling a bit
  * hardy geologist goggles defense boost (which was a measly +2) is now a unique effect (granting 1.1 Defense multiplier), and thus can be stacked with consumables
  * added hard target handling to weakpoison (no more %hp dmg vs special status immune targets)
  * implemented a stacking damage, hybrid bioweapon/hoarfrost, status effect with fixed duration: fuwanderingplague. still needs attaching to a melee weapon
  * extended some effectUtil functions to allow them specify a source for the applied effect

  * extended armor buildscript: it now appends armor class information to the crafting description and has a section above the armor tooltip.

  -- Bugs --
  * corrected duplicate maxHealth in nonpareil top
  * corrected plebeian clothes. the regen is not, nor has ever been, a percentage. it is a flat 0.3 health regen. not 0.3%, not 3%, but 0.3.
  * Fixed an issue where players could not beam up in Extra Dungeons. They now follow the same rules as all other dungeon instances.
  * Decker visor is no longer marked as 1 tier lower than the rest of the set

  ^cyan;6.1.242^reset;
  --------------------
  -- Misc --

  * added Glitchtop, though a far less nasty version than the typical PB variant

  -- Gear --
  * Lances now do their base damage divided by 2 when held out and moving, but lack rotation. This makes them a lethal charging-centric weapon.
  * Ancient Spear, Core Spear and Uranium Spear are now Lances
  * Druid staff has a much tigher circle of projectiles, and no longer deafens half of the known universe when firing. Seriously, sorry about that crap. That hurt the ol' eardrums pretty bad.

  * addjusted UI button colors on Research menu to be a bit more visually pleasing
  * Tweaked the outer hull of the Tenebrhae BYOS.
  * Sea Water is now a source of Magnesium via centrifuge (since we dont do electrolysis)
  * renamed duplicate HiTek Armchair to VR Set Chair
  * Primitive Beds now have the Bed colony tag
  * Leafy Lamps now occupy the correct space for their image

  * tooltip name replace for alt abilities: Energy Aura -> <elementalName> Aura (result for ice weapon: Ice Aura)
  * added support for tag in various buildscripts

  * Corrected a typo in the description of the vanilla Safe
  * Moth Trap II no longer has misaligned sprite in its filled states
  * implemented recursion limit (100 iterations) in railtramstop.lua, because of a recursion error in the vanilla script
  * corrected ZipZaps stance durations to reflect its faster fire time, thus making the weapon actually functional again
  * fixed a case where brain harvesters (via deathbombcomplextreasurepool.lua) werent picking up body material kinda due to a different configuration implementation. repair bots should now properly drop artificial brains.
  * corrected blocker effects on bandages to refer to mutaviskheal (the status effect), rather than mutaviskbandage (the item ID), so people no longer can waste those bandages
  * Tungsten hammers and axes can now be researched
  * Titanium and Durasteel shields no longer appear in the Armory's armour tab
  * due to severe clientside performance impact: reduced base anim update rate for batteries from 10/s to 3/s, reduced further as more batteries are in close proximity (about 16 blocks)
  
  --------------------
  ^cyan;6.1.23 ^reset;

  - Biomes --
  * various parallax tweaks to Aether (terrestrial) biomes
  * Added new subsurface parallax image to replace underground background
  * Added liquid params so terrestrial display shows proper planet blackground (rather than pink erchius)

  -- Misc --
  * added a new Legendary variant of the F4
  * various visual improvements on weapons
  * reduced per-level damage upgrade at Cosmic Crucibles from 15% to 7.5%

  * Changed some of the wording in the novakid race effect description
  * Updated Fenerox default scan descriptions.
  * The Peglaci colony is no longer tile-protected.
  * revised tile protection states on shoggoth's arena. it should no longer be possible to place objects or tiles (except for miniscule windows), and shoggoth will no longer care about shield/field generator usage even if someone DOES manage to place them. It is not, however, recommended to place shoggoth outside of DF2 anymore for that very reason.  
  * added minor, brief, barely noticeable levitation effect to shoggoth if it spends ~9s unable to move while trying to do so, with a brief, tiny movement boost up whatever slope it might be stuck on
  * corrected charge phases, so that shoggoth will no longer stall during them, and instead will transition into a tentacle swipe when in range of the player
  * Dead Core blocks now drop as items when mined.
  * Underground Challenge Lab radar microdungeons should now connect more cleanly to their surroundings.
  * adjusted nearly every seed rarity to match expectations based on research nodes
  * as per above, but for Produce as well as seeds

  -- Bugs --
  * Tungsten Shield appears in the correct station
  * Fixed a checkpoint bug in Mount Gigant allowing players to skip the first Vault Guardian boss fight.
  * corrected Omega Laser mech arm damage scaling
  * Removed the extraction recipe from platinum blocks.
  * The description for the Neuropod Buld had an extra comma that made things look off. Also, the duration of the defense penalty didn't match the description.
  * Fixed a broken laser puzzle in Brine Star, and replaced its rail platforms with solid rail platforms.
  * Mech Repair Pod should properly heal mech health rather than Fuel
  * Added an invisible roof to the Snowcrash mission, and improved the final building.

  ---------------------
  ^cyan;6.1.221 ^reset;
  
  -- Racial --
  * passive stat values for raceeffects are now clamped to ranges as follows:
    - resistances: amount (-1.0 to 1.0), effectiveMultiplier (0.0 to 2.0)
    - max energy and max health: amount(-50 to 50), baseMultiplier(-50% to +50%), effectiveMultiplier(0.7x to 1.5x)
    - protection (Defense): amount(-25 to 25), effectiveMultiplier(0.7x to 1.3x)
    - power (Damage): amount(-0.5 to 0.5), baseMultiplier(-50% to +50%), effectiveMultiplier(0.7x to 1.3x)
    this is primarily to address irresponsible mod authors giving their races excessive values (IE: kitsune patch giving +150% max energy, which is normally +150)

  -- Misc --
  * Made Frackin Collections and FU compatible with CustomCollectionsUI (Now Frackin Collections requires CustomCollectionsUI)
  * removed legacy files
  * Changed shortdesc from cadavers and wrapped corpses.

  * Added missing unlocks for the Pipe Widget and Sewer Pipe, and moved pipe peripherals to the copper furniture node.
  
  -- Bugs -- 
  * Fixed 'Press E to interact' being displayed in the Kirhos, Mantizi and Tenebrhae T0 ships.
  * fixed a recursion issue with fu_nooxygen
  * Fixed an issue causing the Tenebrhae BYOS ship to fail to generate
  * Fixed typo on bee quest.
  * Realigned the Mantizi SAIL. It will no longer bounce around in its chatbox while talking.
  * Fixed a PGI dropped by the blueprint slime glob item.
  * Mantizi now correctly show racial scan text for their items.

	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
Please make sure you are not using anything included in the RED (and ideally the other colors too) on the Info tab below.

A: Yes, there is a Discord server. Check the mods page for a link.

Q: Where can I report issues/bugs, contribute, or make suggestions?

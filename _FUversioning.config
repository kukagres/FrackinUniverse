  ^orange;Official Wiki^reset;: frackinuniverse.miraheze.org^reset;
  
  ^cyan;6.1.24 ^reset;

  -- Assets --
  * new Elduukhar tiles
  * various weapon sprite updates
  * Created a new Mantizi colony, found on nearly any habitable world.
  * Added a new Mantizi painting.

  -- Misc --
  * Sea Water is now a source of Magnesium via centrifuge (since we dont do electrolysis)
  * renamed duplicate HiTek Armchair to VR Set Chair
  * Primitive Beds now have the Bed colony tag
  * Leafy Lamps now occupy the correct space for their image
  * The 'Five Years' music track now plays correctly in biomes and the music player
  * tooltip name replace for alt abilities: Energy Aura -> <elementalName> Aura (result for ice weapon: Ice Aura)
  * added support for tag in various buildscripts
  * corrected aetherium hammer alt: it was referencing a nonexistent aetheraura status effect. the effect now exists, and is a copy of cosmicaura3
  * minor script optimizations in some effect scripts
  * Shoggoth race support updated by its creator
  * Moth Trap II renamed to Moth Trap (Large)

  -- Bugs --
  * Moth Trap II no longer has misaligned sprite in its filled states
  * implemented recursion limit (100 iterations) in railtramstop.lua, because of a recursion error in the vanilla script
  * corrected ZipZaps stance durations to reflect its faster fire time, thus making the weapon actually functional again
  * fixed a case where brain harvesters (via deathbombcomplextreasurepool.lua) werent picking up body material kinda due to a different configuration implementation. repair bots should now properly drop artificial brains.
  * corrected blocker effects on bandages to refer to mutaviskheal (the status effect), rather than mutaviskbandage (the item ID), so people no longer can waste those bandages
  * Tungsten hammers and axes can now be researched
  * Titanium and Durasteel shields no longer appear in the Armory's armour tab
  * due to severe clientside performance impact: reduced base anim update rate for batteries from 10/s to 3/s, reduced further as more batteries are in close proximity (about 16 blocks)
  
  --------------------
  ^cyan;6.1.23 ^reset;

  - Biomes --
  * various parallax tweaks to Aether (terrestrial) biomes
  * Added new subsurface parallax image to replace underground background
  * Added liquid params so terrestrial display shows proper planet blackground (rather than pink erchius)

  -- Misc --
  * added a new Legendary variant of the F4
  * various visual improvements on weapons
  * reduced per-level damage upgrade at Cosmic Crucibles from 15% to 7.5%
  * Added a new underground microdungeons for Peglaci, Mantizi and Tenebrhae
  * Numbers from walls on space stations now available for production in pixel printer.
  * Added minimum block timer to regenerating energy shield code (primarily for wraith armor) of 0.1s
  * genesiberry and soulleaf extracts are going byebye. they can be extracted to get back the seeds. recipes using the extracts now use the seeds, in the proportionate amount.
  * Changed some of the wording in the novakid race effect description
  * Updated Fenerox default scan descriptions.
  * The Peglaci colony is no longer tile-protected.
  * revised tile protection states on shoggoth's arena. it should no longer be possible to place objects or tiles (except for miniscule windows), and shoggoth will no longer care about shield/field generator usage even if someone DOES manage to place them. It is not, however, recommended to place shoggoth outside of DF2 anymore for that very reason.  
  * added minor, brief, barely noticeable levitation effect to shoggoth if it spends ~9s unable to move while trying to do so, with a brief, tiny movement boost up whatever slope it might be stuck on
  * corrected charge phases, so that shoggoth will no longer stall during them, and instead will transition into a tentacle swipe when in range of the player
  * Dead Core blocks now drop as items when mined.
  * Underground Challenge Lab radar microdungeons should now connect more cleanly to their surroundings.
  * adjusted nearly every seed rarity to match expectations based on research nodes
  * as per above, but for Produce as well as seeds

  -- Bugs --
  * Tungsten Shield appears in the correct station
  * Fixed a checkpoint bug in Mount Gigant allowing players to skip the first Vault Guardian boss fight.
  * corrected Omega Laser mech arm damage scaling
  * Removed the extraction recipe from platinum blocks.
  * The description for the Neuropod Buld had an extra comma that made things look off. Also, the duration of the defense penalty didn't match the description.
  * Fixed a broken laser puzzle in Brine Star, and replaced its rail platforms with solid rail platforms.
  * Mech Repair Pod should properly heal mech health rather than Fuel
  * Added an invisible roof to the Snowcrash mission, and improved the final building.

  ---------------------
  ^cyan;6.1.221 ^reset;
  
  -- Racial --
  * passive stat values for raceeffects are now clamped to ranges as follows:
    - resistances: amount (-1.0 to 1.0), effectiveMultiplier (0.0 to 2.0)
    - max energy and max health: amount(-50 to 50), baseMultiplier(-50% to +50%), effectiveMultiplier(0.7x to 1.5x)
    - protection (Defense): amount(-25 to 25), effectiveMultiplier(0.7x to 1.3x)
    - power (Damage): amount(-0.5 to 0.5), baseMultiplier(-50% to +50%), effectiveMultiplier(0.7x to 1.3x)
    this is primarily to address irresponsible mod authors giving their races excessive values (IE: kitsune patch giving +150% max energy, which is normally +150)
